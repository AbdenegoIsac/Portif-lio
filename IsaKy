# Abdenego Isac  

I am a highly motivated professional transitioning into data analysis with a foundation in infrastructure and a growing passion for extracting insights from data. I have been learning **Python**, **Excel**, **Power BI**, **HTML5**, and **prompt engineering** to create simple, accurate, and impactful solutions. Proficient in **GitHub**, I utilize it for project management and collaboration.  

With a strong commitment to continuous learning, I thrive on solving challenges by combining technical skills with creative problem-solving. I am particularly interested in the intersection of data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation to drive smarter decision-making.  

I am eager to contribute to innovative teams, where I can apply my skills and grow as a data analyst, shaping the future of technology.
